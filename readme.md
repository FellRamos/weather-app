# Simple weather server that uses data from:

- api.darksky.net - to get the forecast
- api.mapbox.com - to get the location

To run the app, just clone it and do an `npm ci`  to install dependencies.

Then run it with `npm start` or `npm run start:dev` for development and checkout `localhost:3000` in your browser. Search for your city and that's it :)
